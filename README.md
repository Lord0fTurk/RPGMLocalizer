# RPGMLocalizer

**RPGMLocalizer** is a powerful automated translation tool designed for RPG Maker games. It extracts text from game data, translates it using high-quality machine translation services (Google Translate), and re-inserts it back into the game files, all while preserving game logic, control codes, and scripts.

## Features

-   **Wide Support**: Supports RPG Maker **XP**, **VX**, **VX Ace** (Ruby Marshal) and **MV**, **MZ** (JSON).
-   **Smart Translation**: Automatically handles batching, caching, and concurrent requests for optimal speed and quality.
-   **Context Awareness**:
    -   Preserves RPG Maker control codes (e.g., `\V[1]`, `\N[1]`, `\C[1]`).
    -   Extracts and restores "Show Text" speaker names (MZ Code 101).
    -   Handles plugin parameters (`js/plugins.js`) for MV/MZ.
-   **User Control**:
    -   **Regex Filtering**: Define custom blacklist patterns to skip translating specific text (e.g., file paths, internal keys).
    -   **Glossary Support**: Ensure specific terms are translated consistently or left untranslated.
    -   **Translation Memory**: Built-in cache system prevents re-translating previous sentences, saving time and bandwidth.
-   **Safe & Secure**:
    -   **Automatic Backups**: Creates backups of modified files before saving.
    -   **Robust Error Handling**: Prevents pipeline crashes from individual errors.
